# Welcome

This document is the **Finastra Open API Design Guide** and the intended
audience is designers, developers and consumers of Finastra Open APIs available on the [Finastra Developer Portal](https://developer.fusionfabric.cloud/).

This document introduces the concepts of Finastra RESTful Open APIs and

## Document Conventions

(1) The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”,
“SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in
Finastra standards are to be interpreted as described in [RFC
2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt)

(2) Finastra Open API standards are shown as a table similar to the following:

| Rule Identifier  | Description  |
|:-------:|:------------ |
| WEL-001 |  API designers and developers **SHOULD** follow this document however be aware there is no guarantee that publicly available Finastra APIs will fully adhere to these standards|

The rule identifier comprises a rule type and number - where appropriate the rule identifier corresponds to messages issued by the Finastra linter.
